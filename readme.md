<h1>Advent of code 2023 by Onra77</h1>
<p>This is a repo for the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023">Advent of code 2023</a></p>
<i>Made in Java</i>
<li>source code is in /src</li>
<li>test samples and final inputs are in /ressources</li>
<li>.gitignored Eclipse and classpath files</li>

<p>The approach for this program is "just make it work". The code is ugly, is not made for exposition or inspiration, but is made for fun in the least amount of time possible.
The goal is to go through the whole challenge in the time given. This code is not an example of how I write, it's how I write when I know there are no consequences to my actions.</p>

<p>Edit: As this challenge goes on, I actually make code that I find more and more decent. This remains a result-first approach, but the code is now more and more cleaned up and the solutions have some elegance now.</p>

<h2>Merry christmas</h2>
